									<h2>ECE Discovery Project</h2>
									<h3>Simple AM radio with LM741 Op-Amp and tuning capacitor</h3>
									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>Building a simple AM radio allows me to employ the fundamentals of electronics, radio transmission and reception principles into actual practice
										while also providing a hands-on opportunity for me to explore the interaction between circuit components in creating an actual functional device.</p>
									<h4>Material used</h4>
									<p>
									• LM741 operational amplifier<br>
									• 220 pF variable tuning capacitor<br>
									• 10 nF capacitor<br>
									• 33 pF capacitor<br>
									• 22 μF capacitor<br>
									• toilet paper tube + black insulated wire (for inductor)<br>
									• 22-gauge insulated wires + electrical tape (for antenna)<br>
									• battery<br>
									• jumper wires<br>
									• speaker</p><br>

									<h4>Process and difficulty</h4>
									<p>Since a circuit diagram was previously designed, building the circuit and troubleshooting the connection was fairly quick and successful. I was able to get the supplement parts needed and test each part of the connection with the material provided by the Hive Makerspace.
										A peer instructor in the Hive also helped me with my circuit building by walking me through the working mechanism of the speaker provided and providing some tips on improving the success rate of picking up the signal from an actual radio station. <br>
										However, making the antenna and the inductor was more difficult than I previously expected. Finding the correct gauge for lines to be used takes some time as the number of loops would significantly affect the inductance and the efficiency of antenna.
										Wrapping the correct lines up and fit them into the breadboard was another challenge since the copper end of the wires was very fragile and tended to spread out after using the wire cutter.</p>

									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									<P>I was able to catch some static sound and noise after finishing building the circuit and troubleshooting the connection. After adjusting the tuning capacitor, a very faint AM station could be picked up and distinguished.
									However, possibly due to the long distance to the nearest AM station and the complicated signal environment in the studio, I wasn't able to pick up a more stable and clearer signal.</p><br>

									<h4>Reflection and possible improvement</h4>
									<p>A very positive outcome was obtained for the first attempt building the radio. Based on the result of this attempt, the emphasis of the efforts afterward would focus on getting a stable and clear signal from the radio station.
										Some possible measures to improve the outcome are<br>
									• Finding a method to estimate and adjust the inductance getting from the cylinder to better obtain the frequency desired<br>
									• Replace the variable tuning capacitor with a better one since the old one used in the circuit has very limited adjustment range<br>
									• Increase the radius and the number of loops of the antenna to better pick up signal<br>
									• Move the improved circuit to a place with better signal (get closer to the radio station, if possible)
