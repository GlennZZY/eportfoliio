									<p>I'm Glenn Zhang, an international student from HangZhou, China. I am currently a junior Electrical Engineering student in Georgia Institute of Technology with concentration in bioengineering and signal/info processing, graduating in Dec 2025.<br>
										<br>Growing up in a family open to self-learning and exploration, one of my first memories with electronics, was accidently removing the back panel of my parent's old Dell laptop when they were out, in a firm belief that I could bypass the password by doing something to the "machine" itself.
										Throughout my life afterwards, that image of the "large green panel" (of course, the PCB) always stays with me, and reminds of how electrical engineering could be the fundemental of all the wonderful technological achievement we have obtained in the past several decades.<br>
										<br>My interests in the combination of electrical engineering and bioengineering mainly comes from the sci-fi concept of "Cyborg", especially the 2015 movie <em>Chappie</em>, in which Deon and Yolandi's "consciousness" was transfer into the robot. Although copying and pasting of the consciousness is still unrealistic at the moment, complex moves like manipulating the prosthetics, or playing video games, have been made possible by analyzing and outputting brain signal, from which I firmly convinced that further improvement could be made by diving deeper into decoding neurosignals.<br>
										<br>With strong interests in the topic I am studying, I pride myself in the <strong>EEE</strong> principle I follows for my academics<br>
